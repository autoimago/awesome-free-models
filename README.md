(Poe/Reddit/Perplexity/chat.mistral.ai return HTTP 403 — they block automated checks, not real users; api.oriper.com HTTP 530 and glhf.chat HTTP 522 remain unreachable; Common-Corpus and OpenImageGen on Hugging Face return HTTP 401 and may require authentication). **Corrections this run: ZeroLimitAI is back up (HTTP 200) but its "free tier" is only a 3-day trial — permanent use is a $99 one-time purchase; AI21's trial is $10 for 7 days, not 3 months; BenchLM now tracks 508 models, not 281; FreeLLM.net tracks 505+.** OpenRouter's free lineup is ~20 models right now.

Running AI shouldn't require a credit card. This list curates genuinely free models — open-weight models you can self-host, free API tiers from major providers, and tools to run everything locally.
